**OVERVIEW:**

This project is created to provide utility tools especially based on Excel to support financial planning. This would, IMHO, motivate the user to gain financial literacy which would further enable them to attain a financial freedom.

**TOOLS:**

- **Excellent**
  - **Description:**
    - Tool to project user's financial portfolio based on the user input (i.e., monthly income/expense and expected ROI, ...) 

  - **Usage:**
    - Open the **[Excellent.xlsx](
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MetaNaveen/Excellent/main/Excellent.xlsx)** file with spreadsheet software (only MS Excel is supported for now)
    - Update the cells with blue colored background
    - You will see the updated view of your portfolio

  - **Notes:**
    - You can optionally/experimentally use the publicly shared .xlsx file directly in the browser with this [link](https://indiametamationsoft-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/naveenkumar_metamation_com/EYRslJ1uhGlCtl89gj9mcWsBmv-3Fke7wUp69R7WT6SJ4A). Just make sure no "Guest Contributor" is already working on it.
    - You can use **[Excellent.xlsm](
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MetaNaveen/Excellent/main/Excellent.xlsm)** file to use macro features (using [VBA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/overview/excel)). 
      - Eg: Print button in Dashboard requires macro enabled version
