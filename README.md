**OVERVIEW:**

This project is created to provide utility tools especially based on Excel to support financial planning. This would, IMHO, enable motivated one to gain financial literacy which would further possibly enable to attain a financial freedom.

**TOOLS:**

- **Excellent.xlsx**
  - Tool to project user's financial portfolio based on the user input (i.e., monthly income/expense and expected ROI on investment of the savings, ...) 

  - **USAGE:**
    - Open the xlsx file with spreadsheet software (only MS Excel is supported)
    - Update the cells with blue colored background
    - You will see the updated view of your portfolio
    - You can optionally use the .xlsx file directly in the browser with this [link](https://indiametamationsoft-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/naveenkumar_metamation_com/EYRslJ1uhGlCtl89gj9mcWsBmv-3Fke7wUp69R7WT6SJ4A). Just make sure no "Guest Contributor" is already working on it.

  - **Notes:**
    - Use **Excellent.xlsm** file to use macro (using [VBA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/overview/excel)) features. (Eg: Print button in Dashboard requires macro enabled version)
